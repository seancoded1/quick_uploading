            <p class="text-gray-400 max-w-lg mx-auto leading-relaxed">
                " I was 14 years old and I was working with one of my friends and our band was called 'lewitch' and we were deciding on splitting up because I was always grounded, I didnt have the materials to record, he didnt live close and lost his patience on trying to make it work so we just split. Of course were still friends to this day I mean we been friends since we were in kindergarden and so I came upon a couple names I forgot but it was like really fuckin cheesy or corny or just overall stupid. Then one day my friend was like yo I found a name for myself 'Barozen' and I was like 'What the fuck? How are you so good at making names' and I started to really lock in about the names and then I figured why not take my initials and just add something to the end. then came across 'SG BLACK' and I was like this is it because it feels like me in it yk? Theres really no other way to explain it. But I stuck with it till now and its my band name and thats basically the history of it. A couple weeks later I realized I gotta get my band together because it aint ever gonna work out if I do it to late so I talked to acouple people in my school that I had NO clue who they were, well I mean a little bit because I knew what instrument they played and I came across this drummer guy and he plays in the school band and ive seen all his setups n shit at home and im like I think this guys it. Yeah it has been six months from then and he still didnt reach out to me so I gave up and thought yk maybe this guys not ready to play in a big crowd of people. Its 2026 as of when this message was written and its nobody but me. If you live in my area (pittsburg) then please contact my email I need a drummer, basses, and singer."
